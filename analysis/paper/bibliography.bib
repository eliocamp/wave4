  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses \textemdash{} the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.},

  abstract = {Exploratory analysis using empirical orthogonal function revealed the presence of a stationary zonal wavenumber-4 (W4) pattern in the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the southern subtropics (20\textdegree S\textendash 55\textdegree S). The signal over the Southern subtropics is seasonally phase-locked to the austral summer and persists up to mid-autumn. Thermodynamic coupling of atmosphere and the upper ocean helps in generating the W4 pattern, which later terminates due to the breaking of that coupled feedback. It is found that the presence of anomalous SST due to W4 mode in the surrounding of Australia affects the rainfall over the continent by modulating the local atmospheric circulation. During positive phase of W4 event, the presence of cold SST anomaly over the south-eastern and -western side of Australia creates an anomalous divergence circulation. This favours the moisture transport towards south-eastern Australia, resulting in more rainfall in February. The scenario reverses in case of a negative W4 event. There is also a difference of one month between the occurrence of positive and negative W4 peaks. This asymmetry seems to be responsible for the weak SST signal to the South of Australia. Correlation analysis suggests that the W4 pattern in SST is independent of other natural variabilities such as Southern Annular Mode, and Indian Ocean Dipole as well as a rather weak relationship with El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation.},

  abstract = {Special care must be exercised in the interpretation of multiple statistical hypothesis tests\textemdash for example, when each of many tests corresponds to a different location. Correctly interpreting results of multiple simultaneous tests requires a higher standard of evidence than is the case when evaluating results of a single test, and this has been known in the atmospheric sciences literature for more than a century. Even so, the issue continues to be widely ignored, leading routinely to overstatement and overinterpretation of scientific results, to the detriment of the discipline. This paper reviews the history of the multiple-testing issue within the atmospheric sciences literature and illustrates a statistically principled and computationally easy approach to dealing with it\textemdash namely, control of the false discovery rate.},
